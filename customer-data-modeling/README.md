# Customer Data Consolidation and Deduplication

**Problem Statement**

Ebuy Emporium, a new e-commerce startup, is facing challenges in accurately counting its customer base due to multiple data sources and potential duplicates. The goal is to consolidate customer information from various sources (e-commerce platform, CRM system, and raw transaction data) into a unified and deduplicated dataset.

**Data Sources**

1. **E-commerce Platform:** Contains customer details for registered accounts.
2. **CRM System:** Stores customer information for phone and in-store purchases.
3. **Raw Transaction Data:** Includes purchase details, including guest purchases.

**Data Model**

The final data model will include the following columns:

* `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
* `first_name`: Customer's first name.
* `surname`: Customer's surname.
* `postcode`: Customer's postal code.
* `age`: Customer's age (if available).
* `is_guest`: Indicates whether the customer made a guest purchase.
* `in_purchase_data`: Indicates whether the customer is present in the purchase data.
* `in_crm_data`: Indicates whether the customer is present in the CRM data.
* `in_customer_data`: Indicates whether the customer is present in the e-commerce platform's customer database.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   * Analyze each dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and data quality.
   * Identify potential data inconsistencies and anomalies.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   * Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   * Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, text casing).
3. **Data Transformation:**
   * Extract relevant customer information from each dataset.
   * Create a common schema for all datasets.
   * Combine datasets based on customer IDs and fuzzy matching techniques.
4. **Deduplication:**
   * Identify and remove duplicate records using various techniques (e.g., exact matching, fuzzy matching).
   * Consider factors like name similarity, address similarity, and purchase history.
5. **Data Model Creation:**
   * Construct the final data model based on the deduplicated and combined data.
   * Ensure data integrity and consistency.

**Tools and Techniques**

* **Python:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data structures and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Recordlinkage:** For entity resolution and fuzzy matching.
